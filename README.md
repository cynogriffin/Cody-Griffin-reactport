# React Portfolio 

This project is my portfolio site built using React as well as Tailwind CSS. Please view the full, live site at https://cynogriffin.github.io/cody-griffin-reactport/ and let me know what you think!

This project tests my frontend skills by bulding a completely new site from scratch using React. Employed in the site is React Smooth Scroll and React Icons. I also used a completely new-to-me CSS framework, Tailwind CSS, which helped in making the design clean, modern, and efficient, as well as getform.io for form submission on my contact form.

Some of the challenges I faced were learning a new CSS framework, implimenting new React tools like Smooth Scroll, and figuring out how to make my resume PDF downloadable upon clicking the link.
